# Pirate Audio

Pirate Audio is a range of audio output boards for the Raspberry Pi.

Each board includes an ST7789 240x240 pixel LCD display, four buttons and some form of audio output.


## Hardware

* st7789 display - https://github.com/pimoroni/st7789-python
* four buttons, active low connected to BCM 5, 6, 16, and 24 (A, B, X, Y respectively)

## Installation

You'll need to add the following lines to `/boot/config.txt` to get audio up and running:

```
dtoverlay=hifiberry-dac
gpio=25=op,dh
```

You can also disable onboard audio if you're not going to use it, this sometimes helps applications find the right audio device without extra prompting:

```
dtparam=audio=off
```

## Using with Spotify Connect

If you want to display album art and track information on your Pirate Audio LCD then check out https://github.com/pimoroni/pidi-spotify

Note: PiDi Spotify is currently in beta, and does not work alongside Mopidy. If you want to smush track information into Mopidy from Raspotify see: https://github.com/pimoroni/pirate-audio/issues/17 

## Using With Mopidy

We've created plugins to get you up and running with Pirate Audio and Mopidy.

These will give you album art display, volume, play/pause and skip control.

## Build Your Own

If you're planning to build your own application you'll find some inspiration in examples.

But first you'll need some dependencies:

```
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-rpi.gpio python-spidev python-pip python-pil python-numpy
```

And then you'll need the st7789 library:

```
sudo pip install st7789
```

For more display examples see: https://github.com/pimoroni/st7789-python/tree/master/examples  
Make sure your display software uses BCM pin 13 (not 18 or 19 as for the Breakout Garden version) for controlling the backlight, otherwise there will be no audio output ([reference](https://github.com/pimoroni/pirate-audio/issues/31#issuecomment-678313017)).
